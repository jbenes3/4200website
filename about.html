        This venn diagram shows all the different ways you can get involved in the Data Science field. One big area is of course Computer Science. Many of the skills taught in Data Science courses can also be used in various Computer Science jobs, making it a very versatile degree. However, at the intersection of Computer Science and Math is an ever-growing field - Machine Learning. As the popularity of LLMs such as ChatGPT grow, people need to learn better skills on how to further these AI Models and allow unsupervised learning to occur. This is where this intersection comes in - you need to understand statistical probabilities as well as computer science skills to have a good ML model. Another key field is real-world applications. Data science is a very spanned field - you can analyze data in Biology, Travel, Food, or anything in between. Because of this, good data researchers need to have good understanding in traditional research methods as well so they can understand what the data means. All of these fields combine into one thing - Data Science! This truly shows how the possibilities are endless with a Data Science degree - you can really do anything you put your mind to.
