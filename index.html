        Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Jacob Benesch, and I am a current second-year student at Northeastern University studying Data Science & Business with a concentration in Management. As I am taking a lot of classes that involve different types of data science this semester and have experience in the past, I chose to make my website to show different areas of Data Science you could get involved in for your next passion project. Some of my favorite areas include Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and Data Analysis, all of which will be covered in the website. Overall, my goal with this website is to motivate you to explore the amazing field of Data Science more and maybe get involved in a passion project over the summer or in the near future. Data Science is such a fast-growing industry that can show employers you are up to  date with current technologies and really give you an edge in the competitive job search. I believe there is so much to learn out there about the subject which can make you better equipped to enter the workforce in the future. I canâ€™t wait for you to learn about Data in this website!
